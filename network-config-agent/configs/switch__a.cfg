# --- This part happens in the agent/config_generator.py logic ---

# 1. Get the rendered config string
# new_config_string = render_config_from_template(...)

# 2. Define the target path where the config should be saved
target_device = "switch_a"
output_path = f"configs/{target_device}.cfg" # <--- THIS LINE defines the file to write to

# 3. Write the config to the file
with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write(new_config_string)

# 4. Now, this change must be committed to the GitHub repository.
